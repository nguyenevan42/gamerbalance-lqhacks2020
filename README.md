# GamerBalance

An early prototype of a **webservice designed to help gamers become healthier.** Created for the purpose of submission at LiquidHacks 2020. Some stuff may be buggy/not working due to it being such an early build! To create this project, we depended much on the use of **Adobe XD and Anima** to develop our user interface, translated into **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. In order to implement functionality into the website, we aimed to create the webserver through **Flask** and develop our backend through there. Unfortunately, we were not able to finish in time due to it being a bit of a hefty project for **4 beginners**, but nonetheless we are proud of where we finished!

To run the website it was meant to be run, make sure to install Python and the Flask library. Run app.py to allow the server to be booted up.
